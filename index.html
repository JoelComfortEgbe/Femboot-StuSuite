						When you think about tracking your expenses, it's normal to feel more than a little overwhelmed, especially if you've been avoiding it for a while, or you've never done it before. But the truth is, once you get started really looking at your budget and finances, you'll feel a sense of relief and control; because finally getting on top of your money and debts, comes with huge pay offs -- no more debts and peace of mind!

						We all have different reasons for tracking our expenses; maybe you’re curious about where your money is going, you're working towards a specific goal, or you'd like to deal with your debt once and for all. Whatever your reasons, we've got the tools and resources to help you get started.

						Each new day, a list of tasks awaits us. Some of them are more interesting than others. Nevertheless, the importance of completing these tasks is undisputed, especially if they build upon a daily basis. Normally what happens is that we are either able to complete a preset number of tasks on time or we fail miserably. Although the success rate depends on many factors, there is one common thing that is mostly seen in several use cases. That would be the use of to-do list app. <ul>
